# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to analyze reviews from Amazon Vine members. Amazon Vine invites the most trusted reviewers on Amazon to post opinions about products to help their fellow customers make informed purchase decisions. Among 50 data sets, I selected the Video Games data set to use PySpark and perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, I used PySpark, Pandas, and SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the Video Games dataset. 

## Results 

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three questions for unpaid and paid program reviews (7 pt)
Summary:

The summary states whether or not there is bias, and the results support this statement (2 pt)
An additional analysis is recommended to support the statement (2 pt)
